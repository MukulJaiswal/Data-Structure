	/**
	 * A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the
	 * below-mentioned properties ’
	 * 
	 * The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's
	 * key.
	 * 
	 * The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.
	 * 
	 * Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments; the left sub-tree and
	 * the right sub-tree and can be defined as:
	 * 
	 * left_subtree (keys)  <=  node (key)  <=  right_subtree (keys)
