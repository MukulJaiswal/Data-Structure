	 * 
	 * 
	 * A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since
	 * each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name
	 * them the left and right child.
	 * 
	 * Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1.
	 * 
	 * Count of height starts from 1 then 2^h – 1. Count of height starts from 0
	 * then 2^h+1 – 1. where h is the height
	 * 
	 * In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of
	 * levels is Log2(N+1)
